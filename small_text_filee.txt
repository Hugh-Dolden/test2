An old man going a lone highway,
came at the evening cold and gray,
to a chasm vast and deep and wide,
through which was flowing a even tide.
The old man crossed in the twilight dim,
the sullen stream held no fears for him.
But he turned when safe on the other side,
and built a bridge to span the tide.
'Old man' said a fellow pilgrim near,
'You are wasting strength with building here'.
'Your journey shall end with the ending day',
'You never again shall pass this way'.
'You have crossed the chasm deep and wide',
'Why build you at the even tide?'
The builder lifted his old gray head,
'Good friend on the path that I have come', he said.
'There followeth after me today',
'A youth whose feet must pass this way',
'This stream that has been naught to me',
'To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be'.
'He too must cross in the twilight dim',
'Good friend I am building the bridge for him'.
